//! This file contains benchmarks for the ops traits implemented by HashSet.
//! Each test is intended to have a defined larger and smaller set,
//! but using a larger size for the "small" set works just as well.
//!
//! Each assigning test is done in the configuration that is faster. Cheating, I know.
//! The exception to this is Sub, because there the result differs. So I made two benchmarks for Sub.
